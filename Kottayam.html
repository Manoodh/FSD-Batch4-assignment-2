        <p>Kottayam is a city in the Indian state of Kerala. Kottayam 
            literally means the interior of a fort—Kotta + Akam. Flanked by the Western Ghats on the east and the 
            Vembanad Lake and paddy fields of Kuttanad on the west, Kottayam is a place that is known for extraordinary qualities.
