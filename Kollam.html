        <p>Kollam known by its former name Quilon  is an old
             seaport and city on the Laccadive Sea coast of the Indian state of Kerala. It is situated 66 
             kilometers north of the state capital Trivandrum.The city is on the banks of Ashtamudi Lake. 
             Kollam has a strong commercial reputation since the days of the Phoenicians and Romans. Fed 
             by the Chinese trade, it was mentioned by Ibn Battuta in the 14th century as one of the five Indian 
             ports he had seen during the course of his twenty-four-year travels. Desinganadu's rajas 
             exchanged embassies with Chinese rulers while there was a flourishing Chinese settlement at Kollam. 
             In the 9th Century, on his way to Canton, China, Persian merchant Sulaiman al-Tajir found Kollam to 
             be the only port in India visited by huge Chinese junks. Marco Polo, the Venetian traveller, who was 
             in Chinese service under Kublai Khan in 1275, visited Kollam and other towns on the west coast, 
            in his capacity as a Chinese mandarin. Kollam 
            is also home to one of the seven churches that were established by St Thomas.</p>
