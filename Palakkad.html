        <p>Palakkad  also known as Palghat, is a city and municipality in the state of Kerala in India. 
            It is spread over an area of 26.60 square kilometres (10.27 sq mi). It is the administrative 
            headquarters of the Palakkad District. The city is situated about 350 kilometres (220 mi) 
            north of state capital Thiruvananthapuram, 50 kilometres (31 mi) southwest of Coimbatore in 
            Tamil Nadu, and 66 kilometres (41 mi) northeast of Thrissur on the Salem-Kochi National Highway NH 544. 
            Palakkad is also known as the rice bowl of Kerala. The 18th-century Palakkad Fort has sturdy battlements, 
            a moat, and a Hanuman temple on its grounds. North on the Kalpathy River, the 15th-century Viswanatha 
            Swamy Temple is the main venue of the Ratholsavam chariot festival. 
            Northeast, near Malampuzha Dam, the town of Malampuzha has a rock garden created from recycled materials.</p>
